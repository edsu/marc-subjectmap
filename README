MARC::SubjectMap

MARC::SubjectMap is a set of modules and command line utilities for
translating subject headings in your MARC data.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

HOWTO

First you will need a batch of MARC records to generate a SubjectMap config 
file using the subjmap-tmpl command line tool. You tell subjmap-tmpl what 
subject fields you would like to be examined for translation, and it will 
take a pass through your data and auto-generate your stubbed out 
configuration:

  subjmap-tmpl --in=marc.dat --out=config.xml --translate=650xyzv --copy=650aq 

In this example the x, y, z, and v subfields of the MARC 650 field are extracted
for translation. In addition the configuration will also include instructions
to copy subfields a and q since they do not require translation.
